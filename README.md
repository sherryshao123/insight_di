# Product Metrics Platform 

This is a project I did during Insight Data Engineering program.

### What did I build?
Providing meaningful metrics and improving metricsâ€™ quality is significant for data engineers. But one of problems is s of our it is hard to manage them across the teams, and it is also hard to find out what metrics are available to use. So, I built a centralized metric service platform which can let user choose metrics,  filter conditions they want and show results and dashboards easily and fast.
